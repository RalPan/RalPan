Hi, I’m Raluca Pantilie, a recent graduate of the University of Birmingham with an MSci. in Theoretical Physics.

Bellow you can find examples of my colaborative and individual work. 

The repository IWM-It-Works-on-my-Machine is a collaborative project for the SpaceApps challenge, 48-hour virtual hackathon. We designed a space docking system, which was nominated for global judging. The repository was used to create a website showcasing an animation of the system, as well as details on materials and other backround information. I researched existing systems, modeled and animated the system in Blender, a free 3D modeling software, and wrote parts of the website. 

The other repositories showcase my individual work. Forest-fire-model is a project investigating the Drossel-schwabl forest fire model as part of the "Scientific Computing Laboratory 2" module. Topological_Insulators contains the code to a website I developed for the module "Current Topics in Theoretical Physics". The website presents the theory behind topologically insulating materials.

I’m interested in data science and looking for a job in data analysis.
I’m currently learning SQL, starting with Learning SQL Programming with Scott Simpson on LinkedIn.
