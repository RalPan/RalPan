Hi, I’m Raluca Pantilie, a recent graduate of the University of Birmingham with an MSci. in Theoretical Physics.

Bellow you can find examples of my colaborative and individual work. 

The repository IWM-It-Works-on-my-Machine is a collaborative project for the SpaceApps challenge, 48-hour virtual hackathon. We designed a space docking system, which was nominated for global judging. The repository was used to create a website showcasing an animation of the system, as well as details on materials and other backround information. I researched existing systems, modeled and animated the system in Blender, a free 3D modeling software, and wrote parts of the website. 

I’m interested in data science and looking for a job in data analysis.
I’m currently learning SQL, starting with Learning SQL Programming with Scott Simpson on LinkedIn.

If you want to reach me drop me an email at raluca_pantilie@outlook.com.
